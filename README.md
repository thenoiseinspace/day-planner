## Day Planner

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the workday (9-5). It features HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Moment. 

Click on the middle column to add an item, and then click the save icon in the right column to save it to the planner.

Acknowledgements:
HUGE thank you to James Edwards and Lina Choi! We had a smaller study group (instead of the regular one with everyone) and it worked very well for me. They are very good at explaining concepts.
